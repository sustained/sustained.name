      <p class="mb-4">It's written in Javascript.</p>

      <h2 class="normal-title">What does it do?</h2>

      <p

      >I honestly don't remember, I need to take a look at it. It's been many, many years.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">But I remember specifically two games I was building using it:</p>

      <ul class="mb-4">
        <li>A basic Worms clone</li>
        <li>A top-down spaceship combat game</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="normal-title">What does it look like?</h2>

      <p class="mb-4">Currently no screenshots!</p>
