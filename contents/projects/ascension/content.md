## What is Ascension?

Ascenson is a Memrise clone. It's currently in the early planning/prototyping phase.

If you've ever used Memrise or Duolingo or even Quizlet then that's basically what I'm trying to make.

## Why are you making it?

### Problems with existing solutions

I think that Memrise, for example, has quite a lot of shortcomings. At least, if you look at it from a course creator perspective. If you've ever tried to create (and maintain) a large course then you probably know exactly what I'm talking about.

<!-- TODO: Add examples of shortcomings. -->

There are of course alternatives available, such as Anki but I personally don't really enjoy the UI/UX.

### Interest in language learning

Since I'm a little bit of a language nerd anyway then building something where language learning and technology come together seemed like a great idea... and so here we are.

### Because my other language-learning-related project was too difficult

I guess you could say that Ascension came about because of [another language-learning project of mine](/projects/swedish-for-toads) where I bit off far more than I can chew.

The thing is, I didn't want to stop working on language learning apps entirely as I do enjoy it. That said, I definitely needed to take on something a little bit less ambitious.
